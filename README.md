# python-analyst-coding-exercise
The program was written in Python 3.9 and tested in both Python 3.9 and Python 3.7.3.
Tested in Python IDLE and Jupyter Notebooks.

The input notepad file "items_available" and the program code file "Python_analyst_coding_exercise.py" should be in the same directory.

The code can be executed and the program will be self explanatory if you follow the instructions in the console.

All possible exceptions are thought of and addressed. Exceptions to handle boolean inputs, to accept the available items in the store, to add a valid integer value, to add a valid name in the welcome message.

Logics are included to add an item twice to the cart so that a consolidated invoive is given.

Please follow the instructions in the console , it will safely take you through checkout and exit.

Thanks for the opportunity.
